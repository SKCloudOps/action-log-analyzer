# Example: How to use Action Log Analyzer in your repository
# Add this to YOUR repo's .github/workflows/ folder
#
# Action Log Analyzer provides CI intelligence for BOTH successes and failures:
# - On success: job durations, test results, annotations, slow step detection, warnings, build params, cloned repos, actions/docker refs, artifact URLs
# - On failure: root cause, suggested fix, error context, test results, timing, annotations, warnings, build params, cloned repos, actions/docker refs, artifact URLs
# - Always: retry awareness, workflow context (trigger event, workflow name, run number)
